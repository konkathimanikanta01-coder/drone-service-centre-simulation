# Drone Service Centre Simulation (Arena)

## Project Overview
This project presents a discrete-event simulation of a drone service and repainting centre developed using Arena simulation software. The objective was to analyse operational bottlenecks, queue times, and resource utilisation and provide data-driven recommendations to improve service efficiency and throughput.

This project demonstrates the use of simulation modelling and analytics to support operational decision-making in a service environment.

## Business Problem
Drone service centres often face delays due to repair time variability, repainting processes, and limited technical resources. These delays impact service turnaround time, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

The goal of this project was to:
- Analyse the end-to-end drone servicing process
- Identify bottlenecks and queue build-up
- Evaluate technician and repainting resource utilisation
- Recommend operational improvements using simulation insights

## Tools & Technologies
- Arena Simulation Software
- Microsoft Excel (output analysis)
- Process Mapping & Operational Analysis

## Methodology
- Built a discrete-event simulation model of drone servicing workflow
- Modelled drone arrivals, inspection, repair, repainting, and dispatch
- Ran multiple simulation replications to ensure reliability
- Analysed queue lengths, waiting times, and throughput
- Evaluated resource utilisation and bottlenecks
- Conducted scenario testing to assess improvement strategies

## Key Insights
- Identified repainting stage as major operational bottleneck
- Queue build-up significantly increased turnaround time
- Resource reallocation reduced waiting time and improved throughput
- Simulation demonstrated measurable improvement in service efficiency
- Provided data-driven recommendations for operational optimisation

## Files Included
- Arena simulation model file  
- Simulation results and output analysis (Excel)  
- Full project report  
- Screenshots of model and simulation outputs  

## How to Run the Model
1. Open Arena Simulation Software  
2. Load the Arena model file from this repository  
3. Run simulation using defined parameters  
4. Review results in Arena output window and Excel results file  

## Business Value
This project demonstrates how simulation modelling can be applied to:
- Operations and process improvement
